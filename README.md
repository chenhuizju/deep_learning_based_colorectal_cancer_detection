# deep_learning_based_colorectal_cancer_detection
The proposed method for Colorectal cancer (CRC) detection in contrast-enhanced CT scans utilized the YOLOv11 network as the baseline architecture. A ResNet50 module was incorporated into the YOLOv11 backbone. A scale-adaptive loss function was introduced to adaptively measure IoU and center point distance for improving box regression performance.
